# Connect Four
## Background
Initially coined by Milton Bradley in 1974, Connect Four is a deceptively simple game that took the world by storm. Two players take turns dropping chips down a slot in the top of the board with the goal of getting four of their chips in a row. Because each player has perfect information about the other's position in the game, it is fully dependent on strategy to win the game.

To give an idea of the complexity of the game, in a typical 7x6 grid, there are 4,531,985,219,092 possible positions, and mathematicians have even taken part in developing algorithms and theories to plot optimal player moves.

While the 7x6 grid is the typical layout and typically what one would find in a store, there are multiple iterations and sets of rules that can be played. 

## Rules
This game is a simpler version of the 7x6 grid, encompassing a 4x4 grid. Two human players take turns clicking buttons under each column to "drop" their chip into the next available slot in the grid from the bottom up. The first player to get four in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins! If there is no winner by the time the board is completely filled, the game will be a tie. To start another game, simply hit the reset button in the upper right-hand corner.
