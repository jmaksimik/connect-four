# Connect Four
## Background
Initially coined by Milton Bradley in 1974, Connect Four is a deceptively simple game that took the world by storm.

To give an idea of the complexity of the game, in a typical 7x6 grid, there are 4,531,985,219,092 possible positions, and mathematicians have even taken part in developing algorithms and theories to plot optimal player moves.

While the 7x6 grid is the typical layout and typically what one would find in a store, there are multiple iterations and sets of rules that can be played. 

## Rules
This game is a simpler version of the 7x6 grid, encompassing a 4x4 grid. Two human players take turns clicking buttons under each column to "drop" their chip into the next available slot in the grid from the bottom up.
